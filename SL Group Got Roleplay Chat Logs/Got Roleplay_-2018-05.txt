 You like stripping cars, or whatever else happens by. Maybe you are running contraband between the Cargo Docks and the warehouses in the city.  Or possibly you are the new Mafia boss that runs it all, or just an enforcer acting out, with a little kidnapping and ransom on the side.  Whatever your evil intentions are, there are sheeple waiting to be fleeced.

We have a “What is Known” page that gives an experienced role-player the information about Comraich that they need to get started.  Come explore, and explore again.  Three cities, two villages, and forests in between, every inch of the sim from top to bottom is packed with places to see.
 
 We are an app sim, but visiting role-players are welcome to jump in and RP, as long as they are in medieval clothing.  http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/The%20Known%20World/148/135/1205

 Being the chief researcher in to military applications for nano-technology, with specialist research in xenobiology and exobiology, has its advantages, but at what cost.  I think possibly she was exposed to one too many of her own experiments She seems very excited about her new work, but it is kind of like talking to the mad hatter.

 Is an excavation of ancient ruins of a city, where a space ship that appears to be from your not too distant future has been unearthed. The ship seems to be inhabited.  Making your way through the maze like corridors you locate the bridge, orbiting another planet.  A wrong turn leads you out of the ship, and in to a city of sorts.  In the distance you think you see palm trees and smell rum.

 We offer more role-play and more options then Viking or Torvaldsland Only sims with real conflict, real war, and a real game of thrones against other cultures.  Tired of farming? Try Comraich.
