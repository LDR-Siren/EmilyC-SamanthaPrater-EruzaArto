[2018/03/19 16:06]  Tami (tamarinsofiabennett): there are lots of them.  what type are you looking for?
[2018/03/19 16:06]  Chantal (candicewelch): Realistic? I don't know. As long as it's not Gorean bs.
[2018/03/19 16:07]  Tami (tamarinsofiabennett): try puerto esclava
[2018/03/19 16:07]  Tami (tamarinsofiabennett): or just type slave in search
[2018/03/19 16:08]  seXxys (cindydoll): i think there are many sort of Gorean as well
[2018/03/19 16:08]  ᴅᴀᴡɴ ᴡ. ʀᴏᴡᴇ (albita.jun): She said no gorean
[2018/03/19 16:08]  Chantal (candicewelch): That's alright. Not everyone can read well.
[2018/03/19 16:09]  seXxys (cindydoll): yeh, true, i was just trying to say is not bs
[2018/03/19 16:09]  ᴅᴀᴡɴ ᴡ. ʀᴏᴡᴇ (albita.jun): Uh-huh
[2018/03/19 16:10]  seXxys (cindydoll): oh, i had read her request properly already
[2018/03/19 16:11]  ᴅᴀᴡɴ ᴡ. ʀᴏᴡᴇ (albita.jun): "No gorean bs" sort of wraps the whole concept of gor.
[2018/03/19 16:12]  Liz Osterham (mollymidnighter): Most 'Gorean Roleplayers' can't even roleplay.
[2018/03/19 16:12]  ᴅᴀᴡɴ ᴡ. ʀᴏᴡᴇ (albita.jun): That too.
[2018/03/19 16:12]  Liz Osterham (mollymidnighter): '/me grabs u by the pussy'
[2018/03/19 16:12]  ᴅᴀᴡɴ ᴡ. ʀᴏᴡᴇ (albita.jun): I read two of the books, I barfed at each page. lol
[2018/03/19 16:13]  Liz Osterham (mollymidnighter): It's really telling that 99% of Gorean roleplayers are illiterate and use a lot of netspeak.
[2018/03/19 16:13]  Bāteniān  (cali.ormega): what happened 
[2018/03/19 16:14]  ᴅᴀᴡɴ ᴡ. ʀᴏᴡᴇ (albita.jun): I know some literate gor players but then again it's not the majority.
[2018/03/19 16:15]  seXxys (cindydoll): Gor can be very interesting too
[2018/03/19 16:16]  ᴅᴀᴡɴ ᴡ. ʀᴏᴡᴇ (albita.jun): I think there's this new sim that opened a recently Empire of Ar or something like that which seems to cater to the literate community within gor..
[2018/03/19 16:16]  Basuin Manner (emersonlanks): lol its funny you mention that when the owner of that sim comes in
[2018/03/19 16:16]  Chantal (candicewelch): I suppose my differences with Gor are more fundamental than cosmetic.
[2018/03/19 16:16]  seXxys (cindydoll): i was saying that from the beginning, Basuin !
[2018/03/19 16:17]  ᴅᴀᴡɴ ᴡ. ʀᴏᴡᴇ (albita.jun): Which one of them is the owner lmfao
[2018/03/19 16:17]  Basuin Manner (emersonlanks): not you
[2018/03/19 16:17]  seXxys (cindydoll): phew
[2018/03/19 16:19]  ᴅᴀᴡɴ ᴡ. ʀᴏᴡᴇ (albita.jun): There was this sci-fi sim that was advertising hard for a couple of weeks that had a slavery system but I can't remember the name
[2018/03/19 16:20]  ᴅᴀᴡɴ ᴡ. ʀᴏᴡᴇ (albita.jun): And that Egyptian one, something Lars I think. But that one is historical rp I think.
[2018/03/19 16:20]  Chantal (candicewelch): Thanks. I'll dig around.
[2018/03/19 20:18]  Karrizmaa Resident: Township of Coal Creek is a modern realistic family rp community.

[2018/03/20 17:57]  Damien Cross (damien.christos): True but far less of a PITA
[2018/03/20 17:57]  Meg (margaretweiss): Try Korriban for the Sith, or Tython for the Jedi.

[2018/03/20 18:00]  Damien Cross (damien.christos): Thanks. If I change my mind I'll look in but kinda need to pass. I fall victim to unwritten rules. Like I said, I'm the guy that new rules get made for and pretty much use SL as a glorified chat messenger these days
[2018/03/20 18:01]  Ai ΣDGΣ (alyxiai): shud i use my powers of invisibilty for good or evil? *snorts*

[2018/03/29 16:54]  Meg (margaretweiss): In general, the uni's make you register OUTSIDE of SL before they let you take classes inside.  But that's not RP.
[2018/03/29 16:55]  Meg (margaretweiss): That's an actual, commercial transation separate frol SL.

[2018/03/30 18:23]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): what is your genre?
[2018/03/30 18:23]  Kali (kaliope.karas): urban fantasy
[2018/03/30 18:25]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): And sad to say, not currently involved in any roleplays... so boo
[2018/03/30 18:25]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): good roleplay is hard to find!
[2018/03/30 18:25]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): Modern Fantasy, mostly... but I usually am open to any and all possibilities
[2018/03/30 18:25]  Kali (kaliope.karas): ... come to Unnatural!
[2018/03/30 18:25]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): Unnatural? The one that posted an ad earlier?
[2018/03/30 18:25]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): Unnatural is a pretty nifty sim
[2018/03/30 18:26]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): met some really good people there
[2018/03/30 18:26]  Kali (kaliope.karas): yes, i did post an add earlier
[2018/03/30 18:26]  Kali (kaliope.karas): and thank you Seraphine
[2018/03/30 18:26]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): And sad to say I don't fit the bill there...
[2018/03/30 18:26]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): youre welcome
[2018/03/30 18:26]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): /me winks
[2018/03/30 18:26]  Kali (kaliope.karas): modern fantasy?
[2018/03/30 18:26]  Anky Frostbite (ankoku.starfall): There are a few modern fantasy that advertise if you check out the notices. :)
[2018/03/30 18:27]  Sidney Parx Morgan (sidney.willful): "shadow run is modern fantasy"
[2018/03/30 18:27]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): Hallows End is as well
[2018/03/30 18:27]  Ристенок (ristyenok37): Looking for a sci-fi roleplaying sim. Anyone know of any?
[2018/03/30 18:27]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): Modern fantasy in my listing usually mixes stuff like anthromorphic beings and humans into one setting, never keeping them separate from interaction. So... sad to say, Unnatural does not fit the bill
[2018/03/30 18:28]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): As I'm not capable of being a human due to lack of a human avatar XD
[2018/03/30 18:28]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): Anyways
[2018/03/30 18:28]  Kali (kaliope.karas): ah yeah, no anthros here, sorry :(
[2018/03/30 18:28]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): Like I said, sadly can't fit the bill~
[2018/03/30 18:28]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): Mabbeh one day
[2018/03/30 18:29]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): yeah the thing i dislike about fnatasy is all the combo's
[2018/03/30 18:29]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): Should be just one straightforward thing, shouldn't it?
[2018/03/30 18:29]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): sometimes it feels like people went on mp and just grabbed a bunch of stuff and smashed them together and were like "this is a thing now"
[2018/03/30 18:29]  Anky Frostbite (ankoku.starfall): http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Creative%20Hearts/120/121/802 Has a mix of Shifters, Magical, Humans and Vampires.. it's not masquarade but elite human factions do try to curb the 'unusual'. Brings a bit of fun to the mix.
[2018/03/30 18:29]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): elf ears, dragon wings, goat feet, devil's tail, and mermaid scales... what am i?
[2018/03/30 18:30]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): ^
[2018/03/30 18:30]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): Elf ears, dragon wings, goat feet, devil's tail, mermaid scales... sounds like you're Diablo
[2018/03/30 18:31]  Sidney Parx Morgan (sidney.willful): /me laughs "thats how I feel about most avatars, except they went dumpster diving in the freebie sims and slapped what every they could find together, then said.  Look me Avatar!"
[2018/03/30 18:31]  Kali (kaliope.karas): that's always been a turn off for me.. that and sims with too many races.  always feels disjointed to me, but to each their own.
[2018/03/30 18:31]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): you would think, but then they have this whole backstory about being half orc, fae, drow, troll, dragon warrior
[2018/03/30 18:31]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): "One hell of a party gone awry, the end"
[2018/03/30 18:32]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): and then the like week long character application where i have to rate my skills and magical abilities
[2018/03/30 18:32]  Kali (kaliope.karas): if a dragon mated with a mermaid... and then a werewolf mated with a demon... and their offspring mated.. and then that offspring mated with an elf..
[2018/03/30 18:32]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): and i just i cant with all that nonsense
[2018/03/30 18:32]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): too complicated
[2018/03/30 18:33]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): Again, one hell of a party gone waaay awry, the end
[2018/03/30 18:33]  Ристенок (ristyenok37): so nobody knows of any decent sci-fi sims?
[2018/03/30 18:33]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): not that i know of deary
[2018/03/30 18:34]  Kali (kaliope.karas): i dont, sorry.
[2018/03/30 18:34]  Sidney Parx Morgan (sidney.willful): "It was just an elf lass that was into interspecies gangbangs, then they gave birth to a......"
[2018/03/30 18:34]  Jennifer White-Vlodovic (jenniferwhite1): This is why, within my own 'mating standards', I try to limit generation traits... because good gods, could you imagine a creature being part Fox, Wolf, Demon, Angel, Mermaid, Dragon, Woodelf and Orc in the same generational traits?!! GAH!!
