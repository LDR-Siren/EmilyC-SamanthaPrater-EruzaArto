 A luxury suite on a spaceship, or maybe a cargo hold is more your style, or possibly you want to have a tent in the temple of the dragon.  Maybe you think one of the empty labs would be perfect for your experiments.  The warehouses in the city are large, nefarious activities could be hidden there, and who knows what could be going on in the other buildings.  Contact Starry Questi for rates and Details.
