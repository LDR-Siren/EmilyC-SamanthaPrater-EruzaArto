[2017/12/18 16:56]  AltWrite Resident: The year is 1512 and the most powerful office in the world is up for grabs. A dying Pope will soon leave a void to tempt those who would see themselves above even kings.
 
 Families such as Medici, Sfrorza and Aragon will take all necessary steps in a race to become Pope---a race where greed, ambition, corruption and politics leaves little room for good or God.
