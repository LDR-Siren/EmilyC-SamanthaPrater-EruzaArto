[2018/01/02 14:16]  Jillian Marchant: just curious
[2018/01/02 14:21]  Niccia Straaf: Advertising one's availability in a rp group for apparent non rp tends to put people off, especially when done repetitively.
[2018/01/02 14:24]  KarHallarn Resident: speaks of desperation and possible issues if the ad is accepted.
[2018/01/02 14:26]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore: hmmm

[2018/01/06 17:28]  Seraphine Morello: Hey there!! anyone looking for a long term roleplay opportunity in a modern urban sim? We are looking for human characters to join our pawn shop roleplay (clerks, bounty hunters, gun reps) or to be a part of our adult entertainment production company: Cherry on Top Productions. Yes this is for roleplay. Still not quite what you are looking for? Thats cool, We are also leading a 1% Outlaw Motorcycle roleplay. Any of that sounds interesting, please send me a message or Giovanni Morello (Zander.Bracken) so taht we can answer all your questions
[2018/01/07 13:06]  Abraham Lynch (abraham.redinamus): More Firefly RP on it's way??....
 Yes, you heard it right, more FFRP on it's way, but to do so... we need to hear who would be up to that... we are tired that our RP communities ended up in just good memories and now we spend time sim wandering or playing some other stuff... I dunno you guys, but I'm eager to keep writing a few more adventures with another crew.
 So drop me a line (Abraham Lynch), if you would be up to keep flying and aiming to misbehave.
[2018/01/07 13:07]  VishousPayne Nitely: Firefly??
[2018/01/07 13:08]  Abraham Lynch (abraham.redinamus): indeed
[2018/01/07 13:08]  VishousPayne Nitely: I aim to misbehave, Firefly?
[2018/01/07 13:08]  Abraham Lynch (abraham.redinamus): are ya familiar with Firefly/Serenity?
[2018/01/07 13:08]  VishousPayne Nitely: /me laughs

[2018/01/07 13:10]  VishousPayne Nitely: Fantastic. Love to see it.
[2018/01/07 13:10]  Liyah Narok (liyahdeloncroix): You know that could be fun
[2018/01/07 13:10]  Abraham Lynch (abraham.redinamus): but we want to know if people would still be interested in playing it
[2018/01/07 13:13]  VishousPayne Nitely: I don't see why not.
[2018/01/07 13:14]  VishousPayne Nitely: although I vote for a Bioshock sort of sim
[2018/01/07 13:14]  Liyah Narok (liyahdeloncroix): Make it and see them come. Its Firefly who doesn't know of it and if you don't you can learn pretty quick about it
[2018/01/07 13:14]  Abraham Lynch (abraham.redinamus): never seen a bioshock rp sim before... so... no, no bioshock... just Firefly lol
[2018/01/07 13:16]  VishousPayne Nitely: Mine was Bioshock. Elation City

[2018/01/13 15:17]  Auryon Achlys (raelynmoira): most come with standard layers too
[2018/01/13 15:17]  Ana Marie (xxanaconda23xx): or submissive dom stuff
[2018/01/13 15:17]  Auryon Achlys (raelynmoira): and tattoos
[2018/01/13 15:17]  Evelyn Velt (eve3322): /me changes subject real fast ^
[2018/01/13 15:17]  Auryon Achlys (raelynmoira): All my catwa applier stuffs come with standard layers to apply too
[2018/01/13 15:18]  Evelyn Velt (eve3322): Catwa is 5k
[2018/01/13 15:18]  Auryon Achlys (raelynmoira): so worth it
[2018/01/13 15:18]  ᴘʀᴇᴛᴛʏ ᴋɪʟʟᴇʀ (itonami.hilltop): /me rolls onto his back.
[2018/01/13 15:18]  Evelyn Velt (eve3322): I am looking for some lipstick and eye shadow
[2018/01/13 15:18]  ᴘʀᴇᴛᴛʏ ᴋɪʟʟᴇʀ (itonami.hilltop): Nightmorne has a BDSM club, but its not the main focus.
[2018/01/13 15:18]  Evelyn Velt (eve3322): Yes I hear you but I have to pay the rent
[2018/01/13 15:18]  Evelyn Velt (eve3322): know what I'm sayin'?
[2018/01/13 15:19]  Ana Marie (xxanaconda23xx): i didnt mean bdsm i ment submissive dom sims
[2018/01/13 15:19]  Auryon Achlys (raelynmoira): catwa has a basic head too that's 910
[2018/01/13 15:19]  Evelyn Velt (eve3322): No one cared Ana.
[2018/01/13 15:19]  Evelyn Velt (eve3322): okay well thanks for the help anyway, back to the whips and chains
[2018/01/13 15:20]  ᴘʀᴇᴛᴛʏ ᴋɪʟʟᴇʀ (itonami.hilltop): first sentance was 'any bdsm sims around'

[2018/01/15 19:13]  Shapeshifterr Resident: Ravengarde Hollow - Newly Open Steampunk/Victorian/Medieval Fantasy twisted world. Hope to see you soon! http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Rosco/73/91/1201
[2018/01/15 19:13]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): thats a lot of things
[2018/01/15 19:13]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): ¯\(°_o)/¯
[2018/01/15 19:14]  Abraham Lynch (abraham.redinamus): Steampunk?... are furries allowed there?
[2018/01/15 19:15]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): Yes.
[2018/01/15 19:16]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): As long as their clothing is between Medieval and Victorian cross over. Think almost like WoW when it comes to style.
[2018/01/15 19:16]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): But more Victorian based sim design and we allow almost all races and furries.
[2018/01/15 19:17]  Abraham Lynch (abraham.redinamus): then I'm out of there...
[2018/01/15 19:17]  Abraham Lynch (abraham.redinamus): good luck with that folks... cuz' I love steampunk
[2018/01/15 19:17]  Krull Darkshine (krulldarkshine): If he's out then I'm in, I'll be sure to check it out. lol
[2018/01/15 19:19]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): so bascially like everything that anyone would want to rp could be rp'ed there
[2018/01/15 19:19]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): i gues thats one way to get traddic
[2018/01/15 19:19]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): "we allow all the things!"
[2018/01/15 19:19]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): I said almost all races.
[2018/01/15 19:19]  Robin (paperrobin): It seems to be the current formula for medieval fantasy sims.
[2018/01/15 19:20]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): Furries that are done correctly allowed. I don't want mickey mouse running around.
[2018/01/15 19:21]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): oh and the crack down begins!
[2018/01/15 19:21]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): *eye rolls*
[2018/01/15 19:21]  Jay Biafra (julian.quinzet): /me sits on his porch and sips his ice tea
[2018/01/15 19:21]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): im just being an ass
[2018/01/15 19:21]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): dont mind me
[2018/01/15 19:21]  Jay Biafra (julian.quinzet): /me lipton specifically
[2018/01/15 19:21]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): if fantasy werent so complicated id be into it
[2018/01/15 19:22]  Pauleh Resident: I wouldn't mind the ones using Jomo avatar etc but a bright colored cartoon animal would kill the immersion for me
[2018/01/15 19:22]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): Trust me this is new territory to me. I like medieval, but we wanted to try something new and different.
[2018/01/15 19:22]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): but when there are huds and spell casts and who is a half orc fae demon drow
[2018/01/15 19:22]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): i get lost
[2018/01/15 19:22]  Jay Biafra (julian.quinzet): That would be one ugly mug, Sera.
[2018/01/15 19:22]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): Yeah no, Jomo and like, nice normal furred creatures are fine. Not pink zebras. Its in our notes.
[2018/01/15 19:23]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): jomo makes some awesome furry bodies
[2018/01/15 19:23]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): like super hot
[2018/01/15 19:23]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): Well, actually about the magic thing...
[2018/01/15 19:24]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): The concept has magic banned and deemed evil and can get you killed on sight, leaving alll rp totally up to the players. We nominated a excellent person to play our governor, who has banned everything. Now its up to the people to either bring magic back or become more along the new engineering ways. ¯\(°_o)/¯
[2018/01/15 19:24]  Caideus Hex (milo.paolino): Catherilla I agree, it is there Sim their L$ and their time building their Sim.
[2018/01/15 19:25]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): banning eveything dothn not make an excellent mayor
[2018/01/15 19:25]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): xD
[2018/01/15 19:25]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): /me giggles
[2018/01/15 19:25]  Jay Biafra (julian.quinzet): I do think it's fine to let people comment on RP sims and ask questions when ads come by. Not insult, but talk about. Your sim concept sounds super fun Taissa.
[2018/01/15 19:26]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): Thank you Jay!
[2018/01/15 19:26]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): It sure does sound interesting
[2018/01/15 19:26]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): lol ibe been lurking here like i usually do
[2018/01/15 19:26]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): its nto often i see a medieval sim pop up
[2018/01/15 19:26]  Jay Biafra (julian.quinzet): You're very welcome! I am more of a urban RP sort of guy myself though sometimes dabble in a bit of the vamp.
[2018/01/15 19:27]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): We're trying something different, and if the roleplayers want something different, we give it to them. We're open to change and modifying. So if anyone wants to pop by please do.
[2018/01/15 19:27]  Krull Darkshine (krulldarkshine): There's nothing wrong with enforcing an aesthetic for a RP sim, beauty is the owner can allow or disallow whatever or whomever they wish. However having an open mind can be very beneficial to both RP and traffic.
[2018/01/15 19:27]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): i dont have time to dabble lol
[2018/01/15 19:27]  Jay Biafra (julian.quinzet): I like to have an open mind with mine, it's been fun!
[2018/01/15 19:28]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): Exactly! Open minds and lots of fun. Im strict to RP styles and things must be earned but I also want everyone to feel at home.
[2018/01/15 19:29]  Jay Biafra (julian.quinzet): Is it built already??
[2018/01/15 19:29]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): /me nods
[2018/01/15 19:30]  Jay Biafra (julian.quinzet): LM?
[2018/01/15 19:30]  Krull Darkshine (krulldarkshine): Not all of us (furs) are the bubbly skittle colored yiff machines, many of us try to go as realistic as we can and RP accordingly. I'm not going to be angry with a sim owner or administration that prohibits "us" from RPing, but as this avatar is all I have it's going to keep me from being a citizen/tenant/RPer/supporter.  So I encourage people to keep open minds.   (This is not aimed at anyone in this chat in particular.)
[2018/01/15 19:31]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): I put it together in two days, but I'm still constantly tweaking as needed. Like I said, it's more victorian than medieval, but we allow armor and such and more medieval races, like World of Warcraft in a weird way.
[2018/01/15 19:31]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Rosco/75/91/1201
[2018/01/15 19:32]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): That's to our welcome center. There is a button in the elvator that drops you down below, literally. We have to fix that tomorrow xD
[2018/01/15 19:32]  Caideus Hex (milo.paolino): How about Witches?
[2018/01/15 19:32]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): Witches are classified under Mages in a sense via Unity Maxim meter.
[2018/01/15 19:32]  Caideus Hex (milo.paolino): cool
[2018/01/15 19:33]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): So if you label as a Mage and RP as a Witch that's fine. I've always been mad there wasn't a Witch label for Unity D:
[2018/01/15 19:33]  Caideus Hex (milo.paolino): I have been to Sim's that allow mages and such but not a witch
[2018/01/15 19:33]  Caideus Hex (milo.paolino): never quite understood that but ohh well
[2018/01/15 19:34]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): Sameee.
[2018/01/15 19:34]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): I love witches.
[2018/01/15 19:34]  KarHallarn Resident: "Witch" is a type of magic user. as such they would fall under the umbrella moniker of "mage"
[2018/01/15 19:35]  Caideus Hex (milo.paolino): I didn't argue with them over it, just found a different Sim
[2018/01/15 19:35]  Taissa Caldwell (shapeshifterr): Pretty much. I've had to do that before. But, there are ways around everything. Afterall its the RP that matters.
[2018/01/17 11:55]  legoiceking Resident: hey guys
[2018/01/17 11:58]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): what's up Lego

[2018/01/17 12:55]  Absynthe (absyntheingram): "And that, boys and girls, is why Abbie says outrageous things. It generates interest!"
[2018/01/17 12:56]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): I am aware
[2018/01/17 12:56]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): I was merely making conversation

[2018/01/17 12:58]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): isnt that an alcoholic beverage?
[2018/01/17 12:58]  ᴘʀᴇᴛᴛʏ ᴋɪʟʟᴇʀ (itonami.hilltop): yes, but i've heard it in songs, but I dont know what they mean...
[2018/01/17 12:59]  Jonathon Spires: drank it once. wouldn't again :D
[2018/01/17 13:00]  Firefly (firefly.lovell): Absinthe is okay, nothing special.

[2018/01/17 13:00]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): whats special then?
[2018/01/17 13:00]  Jonathon Spires: the real stuff with wormwood is not the same as the us stuff
[2018/01/17 13:01]  Firefly (firefly.lovell): It's flavoured with wormwood which can be poisonous in excess and is said to have hallucinogenic qualities.
[2018/01/17 13:01]  Jonathon Spires: i found it to be wierdly "chatty" anyway, was a long time ago
[2018/01/17 13:02]  Firefly (firefly.lovell): I'min the UK, it's never been illegal here.
[2018/01/17 13:04]  Firefly (firefly.lovell): Thing is, it tends to be very high in alcohol content so I'm likely to be asleep through drinking too much before any funny effects can be noticed. :P
[2018/01/17 13:11]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): that santa ramona notice is so agains tth rules lol

[2018/01/20 17:40]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): i dont understand why people go to random groups and ask for stuff that is not what the group is meant for. Its like going into a Harley Dealership asking where you can get flowers...
[2018/01/20 17:40]  Liyah Narok (liyahdeloncroix): Alerting a Moderator Now you are rude
[2018/01/20 17:40]  Rook (ken.spaartza): looks like the short answer to your question is "no."
[2018/01/20 17:40]  Kitten (lagertha4): /me mumbles something about people needing to get laid
[2018/01/20 17:42]  Liyah Narok (liyahdeloncroix): Told a mod and blocked her. Everyone have a great night beyond this
[2018/01/20 17:42]  Liyah Narok (liyahdeloncroix): Blocked the girl not the mod
[2018/01/20 17:43]  Valoric (woricksama): literally like a minute ago?
[2018/01/20 17:44]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): Got roleplay is for Role plays not blogs

[2018/01/20 17:45]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): /me gets popcorn, "Two mods, its like when two cops show up when they pull you over." she whisperes to no one in particular
[2018/01/20 17:45]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): I have ejected kitten naire form the group
[2018/01/20 17:45]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): please be patient while sl updates
[2018/01/20 17:46]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): /me cheers on Lego "whoooooo"
[2018/01/20 17:47]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): its a term of endearment
[2018/01/20 17:48]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): /me slaps her hands over her mouth "oops"
[2018/01/20 17:48]  Missy (missaire.zimmermann): Look. You shouldn't have been called that, Kitten, however you also should not be asking for something in group that the group is not designed for. Move on.
[2018/01/20 17:48]  Rook (ken.spaartza): SL needs a Like button for posts like Sera's
[2018/01/20 17:48]  Rook (ken.spaartza): id spam the shit out of it

[2018/01/22 06:28]  Mimi Purr (mimiemay): {Hollow's End} City of Enchanted Nightmares and Cursed Dreams
 
 Entering of Hollow's End, it's almost a dream; slipping into the comforting arms of a warm bath, or a sensation of Deja vu that beckons from the dark places to draw you in. The exceptions being those found intoxicated with terror or baleful remorse who entered Hollow's End through some form of traumatic experience. As random as the cards, as insightful as Karma, the sewn roots of uncountable dimensions have been knotted to this realm called Hollow's End: A limbo oubliette that could be Shangri-La or Sheol to each person who finds themselves ensnared in the morose city or surrounding countryside.
 
 What will become of you?

[2018/01/22 06:28]  Kain Donoghue (malakaigable): We are seeking passionate and creative leads and admins to be apart of a dark adult modern, semi-masqueraded supernatural sim, that is opening soon.  If interested, apply here.  https://goo.gl/forms/x7tAoBfvCJxNuLBa2
[2018/01/22 16:40]  Shin (shinmakoto): ^anyone can answer this, i know samantha is busy
[2018/01/22 16:40]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): they will review and reword I believe
[2018/01/22 16:40]  Pauleh Resident: Easiest is to just scratch rule 7
[2018/01/22 16:40]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): advertisers make your posts clean and then keep posting, they will be in touch if there's an issue for now.
[2018/01/22 16:41]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): at least that is what I got from the convo
[2018/01/22 16:41]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): were updating rules now
[2018/01/22 16:41]  Shin (shinmakoto): Woo good deal :D
[2018/01/22 16:41]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): The 1920s Berlin Project for example, is a historic rp sim in which absolutely NO FANTASY, ANIME, FURRIES, can enter the sim. They have a strict dress 1920s dress code.
[2018/01/22 16:41]  Missy (missaire.zimmermann): Take your time!
[2018/01/22 16:41]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): thats debatale i know some great historic looking furs
[2018/01/22 16:42]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): i can understand not allowing furs with unatural colors
[2018/01/22 16:42]  Branwyn Emerald: Wow
[2018/01/22 16:42]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): like 80% of their body is the color RAINBOW
[2018/01/22 16:42]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): but what about the more normal looking 2 or 3 toned furs?
[2018/01/22 16:42]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): erm
[2018/01/22 16:43]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): but historic sims like 1920 Berlin Project, the sim owner will come for you if she see you as a furry and ask you to either be a human and conform to the dress code or leave.
[2018/01/22 16:43]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): if it's historic, wouldn't that mean more-so rl-based in the sense of humans?
[2018/01/22 16:43]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): don't thnk that fits a few RP themes at all.  just like a knight in full armor, or a guy in board shorts.
[2018/01/22 16:43]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): Yes malphas
[2018/01/22 16:43]  Missy (missaire.zimmermann): The thing is Lego, the sim OWNER is the one who gets to decide what s/he wants on THEIR sim. I don't think any group has the right to decide if those choices are "correct" or not. You need to let the PLAYERS vote with their feet instead.
[2018/01/22 16:43]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): Ok, let me put it to you this way
[2018/01/22 16:43]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): I couldn't tell if we were just being hypothetical about adding furries into that time period or joking
[2018/01/22 16:44]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): Missy, This is gonna sound hard, and very blunt, Your sim you own  youc an do whatever you want, but, if you want to advertise HERE you have to abide by the gorups rules, or else you wont get notice rights
[2018/01/22 16:44]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): Sim owners of historic rp sims are very, very strict with that. They do not want any fantasy characters and they will indicate that on their own rules.
[2018/01/22 16:45]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): Malphas it was a hypothetical
[2018/01/22 16:45]  SamanthaPrater Resident: Simmer down simmer down
[2018/01/22 16:45]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): alrighty just checking, so does that mean historic sims aren't allowed for being thematic then?
[2018/01/22 16:45]  Pauleh Resident: But now it's getting to... if we don't allow furies can we not advertise here
[2018/01/22 16:45]  Missy (missaire.zimmermann): I understand. I don't HAVE an RP sim atm, but I predict you'll lose a lot of group enrollment this way. Just saying :)
[2018/01/22 16:45]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): We discussed this several months ago, and this is not what I understood from Bioblaze.
[2018/01/22 16:45]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): like the aforementioned thematic sims o.0?
[2018/01/22 16:45]  SamanthaPrater Resident: Ok Ok , lets simmer down before a war breaks loose in chat
[2018/01/22 16:46]  SamanthaPrater Resident: lets talk .. puppies! (holds up a puppy) Everyone likes these guys.
[2018/01/22 16:46]  Missy (missaire.zimmermann): Oh no warfare here, no worries :)
[2018/01/22 16:46]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): Did this rule notecard come from Bioblaze?
[2018/01/22 16:46]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): everyone seems perfectly simmered, lol, just seeing questions seeking clarification
[2018/01/22 16:46]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): what breed puppy?
[2018/01/22 16:46]  Onishi Yatsuko (amiru.verne): I still just don't understand what sims can advertise and which can't now.
[2018/01/22 16:46]  SamanthaPrater Resident: oh, King chavilver spaniel
[2018/01/22 16:46]  SamanthaPrater Resident: there so cute
[2018/01/22 16:46]  Pauleh Resident: Yeah, and for some reason a straight up answer can't be given
[2018/01/22 16:46]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): I'm not simmered, I'm calm :D
[2018/01/22 16:47]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): I'm just not seeing that requiring all sims to accept furries is helpful. Or child avis. Or astronauts. Or cavemen.
[2018/01/22 16:47]  Missy (missaire.zimmermann): ^exactly
[2018/01/22 16:47]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): I don't think it's a war, just clarification.  Do all sims have to allow for everything.  Game of Thrones has to allow for cyborgs?  Steampunk allow for authentic knights?  Modern allow for medieval?
[2018/01/22 16:47]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): In our 1950s sim, it's family based, we do allow child avis in our sim
[2018/01/22 16:47]  Missy (missaire.zimmermann): If I'm reading Lego correctly, his answer to that is Yes.
[2018/01/22 16:48]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): We have a few teen avis already
[2018/01/22 16:48]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): That is what I am worried about too, Missy.
[2018/01/22 16:48]  Hana (villadelfia): I'm glad I'm stepping down as owner next week XD
[2018/01/22 16:48]  Pauleh Resident: I don't allow child avatars because that's a headache I don't need :P
[2018/01/22 16:48]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): yea, can't begin to recount how many times I've seen some grown character in medi trying to tug around a prepubescent boy or some crap on a chain.
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): I'm an admin of the sim I rp in but the owners allow me to advertise when theyr'e busy with other things
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): Themed sims are an exception to rule 7
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): said it earlier too x3
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): what about period sims?
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Pauleh Resident: Aren't all RP sims themed sims?
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Hana (villadelfia): All sims are themed.
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): That is a theme
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): most all are themed
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Pauleh Resident: minus family sims which is a mix of rp/living
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): lol
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Branwyn Emerald: ^^^^^
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): I sent a message to the group owner, hopefully he will reply soon to clarify.
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Hana (villadelfia): There is no such thing as a sim without a theme.
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Missy (missaire.zimmermann): all sims are.. yes.. themed
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): ^
[2018/01/22 16:49]  SamanthaPrater Resident: for the longest I didnt even know who was the owner.
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): To RP sim owners: please don't leave the group, just be a little patient.
[2018/01/22 16:49]  SamanthaPrater Resident: so, there is that.
[2018/01/22 16:49]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): unless you're just selling rentals... all RP sims are themed
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): Man this is a matter of semantics
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Onishi Yatsuko (amiru.verne): Yes, I don't see the point of rule 7?  The majority of sims are themed in someway that will not allow every type of character.
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): Agreed onishi
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): more so themed like nocturne, or a historical rp
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): or game of thrones
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Pauleh Resident: Does that exclude urban sims?
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Pauleh Resident: Post apoc?
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Onishi Yatsuko (amiru.verne): urban supernatural
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): every sim has it's theme, that owners typically alter even in the slightest bare minimum to have some sense of uniqueness, think nocturne is urban fantasy?
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): So we're going to say some sims can be themed and allow exceptions/exclusions... and some cannot?
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): urban supernatural, even
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): who is to say?
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Branwyn Emerald: What about my custom fiction fantasy sim, do I have to allow furries now?
[2018/01/22 16:50]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): or realistic, or human, or farm communities, or urban realistic, etc., etc.
[2018/01/22 16:51]  SamanthaPrater Resident: =^-^=
[2018/01/22 16:51]  Nell Mochi (nellsvocea): a roleplay group cant dictate a sims rules o.O its two com
[2018/01/22 16:51]  Nell Mochi (nellsvocea): letely different entities
[2018/01/22 16:52]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): they can pick and choose who they will allow ad rights to, tho
[2018/01/22 16:52]  Shin (shinmakoto): theyre not nell. XD
[2018/01/22 16:52]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): what Evelyna said
[2018/01/22 16:52]  Onishi Yatsuko (amiru.verne): True. But... what Eve said.
[2018/01/22 16:52]  SamanthaPrater Resident: it is also our group, so that takes it as well, but as a RP Group posting we need to accept many but we have our rules
[2018/01/22 16:52]  Pauleh Resident: I mean the group here is fully in the rights to decide what type of advertisements they want posted here, all I want is clarity on the rules.
[2018/01/22 16:52]  Shin (shinmakoto): but it will dictate how many people will be able to use the group
[2018/01/22 16:52]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): and it sounds like from one bold faced typer, that some sims are okay to have exclusions and some are not...
[2018/01/22 16:52]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): This is Bioblaze's group.
[2018/01/22 16:52]  Nell Mochi (nellsvocea): im confused. So i
[2018/01/22 16:52]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): He should be writing or at least approving official changes to rules. When I talked to him about this exact same issue some months ago, he told me the only rule is no commercial postings.
[2018/01/22 16:53]  Nell Mochi (nellsvocea): if the group doesnt like the sims rules they can just not advertise it?
[2018/01/22 16:53]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): he also told me the only rule was no bots xD
[2018/01/22 16:53]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): I was very specific in asking him, because this EXACT thing came up, and people left the group.
[2018/01/22 16:53]  SamanthaPrater Resident: Ok so ignore the group rules for right now folks.
[2018/01/22 16:53]  Shin (shinmakoto): maybe..make.. a notice about that XDD
[2018/01/22 16:53]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): i also asked him some time ago to come up with grou rules and he never did
[2018/01/22 16:53]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): I'll try
[2018/01/22 16:53]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): 'may' want to rephrase that bit
[2018/01/22 16:53]  SamanthaPrater Resident: just DO NOT ask for linden , or post commercial things.
[2018/01/22 16:53]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): lol
[2018/01/22 16:53]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): and no bots
[2018/01/22 16:54]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): and no thirstin'
[2018/01/22 16:54]  DДVID LΞБLЦΞ DΞCДУ™ (canadiandevil91): and no anal sex
[2018/01/22 16:54]  SamanthaPrater Resident: I think the best thing is to basically let HIM write the rules.
[2018/01/22 16:54]  Shin (shinmakoto): just incase some poor sap like me only sees the notices afterward and goes 'wat'
[2018/01/22 16:54]  DДVID LΞБLЦΞ DΞCДУ™ (canadiandevil91): jesus is watching
[2018/01/22 16:54]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): for sex
[2018/01/22 16:54]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): good luck y'all
[2018/01/22 16:54]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): I meant to say, "no thirstin for sex"
[2018/01/22 16:54]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): /me sighs
[2018/01/22 16:54]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): I'm mentally exhausted
[2018/01/22 16:54]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): yeaa
[2018/01/22 16:54]  Pauleh Resident: Who wrote these rules anyway?
[2018/01/22 16:54]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): I think the only thing to do is to let him write, or approve, the rules. Especially since we're talking about forbidding things that he specifically said were not forbidden just last fall.
[2018/01/22 16:55]  Hanwiyanpa 0Moonlight0 (lovelyterror): no worries yibo
[2018/01/22 16:55]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): I think it's safe to say, we could all probably use a drink right 'bout now
[2018/01/22 16:55]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): The admins wrote these rules
[2018/01/22 16:55]  SamanthaPrater Resident: yes but we didnt include every admin there, Lego
[2018/01/22 16:55]  Pauleh Resident: All of them?
[2018/01/22 16:56]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): the issue is our group owner is not on/active
[2018/01/22 16:56]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): and we can barely reach him on discord
[2018/01/22 16:56]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): Oh dear
[2018/01/22 16:56]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): But we can't just add a bunch of rules that he specifically said were not rules.
[2018/01/22 16:56]  Hanwiyanpa 0Moonlight0 (lovelyterror): 0.0 oh dear
[2018/01/22 16:57]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): yeah, not the best place for that announcement, prolly
[2018/01/22 16:57]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): he was clear and this group is very calm normally anyway.
[2018/01/22 16:57]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): that'd likely be something to in group contact him on, hate to be that guy, but inactive or not it's still by means of technicality his group, if ya want to do yo thang ya can always make another one at some point, not that I'm suggesting it, rather than talk that out here yea?
[2018/01/22 16:57]  SamanthaPrater Resident: Ok Can  the admins take they're disagreements in IMS?
[2018/01/22 16:57]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): I just don't want people to leave over this, as happened last fall... that's why I finally chimed in.
[2018/01/22 16:57]  SamanthaPrater Resident: I feel like this entire thing has gone too far, and needs to cease.
[2018/01/22 16:58]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): if people leave people leave
[2018/01/22 16:58]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): Cease and desist
[2018/01/22 16:58]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): were not here to be their floor mat
[2018/01/22 16:58]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): wow
[2018/01/22 16:58]  SamanthaPrater Resident: No but there is a professionalisim that is needed Lego.
[2018/01/22 16:58]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): don't think anyone said ya were? believe you're taking it a tad personal
[2018/01/22 16:58]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): Ive been in got role for a long itme
[2018/01/22 16:58]  Shin (shinmakoto): woah someone needs a snickers
[2018/01/22 16:59]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): I wish I had one right now
[2018/01/22 16:59]  Hanwiyanpa 0Moonlight0 (lovelyterror): I would think you would want people to say
[2018/01/22 16:59]  Pauleh Resident: I'm literally just waiting on clarity for these rules, if they aren't right then a new notice should go out saying to ignore them or something.
[2018/01/22 16:59]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): when ever we step in  to quell or end soemthing iits usally hordes that leave
[2018/01/22 16:59]  Evelyna Callix (blueridgechick): OMG!  yes, snickers for ALLLLL
[2018/01/22 16:59]  Malphas Vok'narok (kiro.ametza): I want a kit kat bar
[2018/01/22 16:59]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): Snickers sounds good right about now
[2018/01/22 16:59]  Legoiceking Pawlicker Furditore (legoiceking): I for onw, have stopped carign about hurt toes

[2018/01/22 16:59]  SamanthaPrater Resident: Lego.. take a break, back away.
[2018/01/22 16:59]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): don't mention no snickers, that might trigger a craving that I can't control
[2018/01/22 16:59]  SamanthaPrater Resident: I did send those out Pauleh
[2018/01/22 16:59]  Pauleh Resident: aha found it
[2018/01/22 16:59]  SamanthaPrater Resident: IGNORE THE NEW RULES. UNTILL CLAIRIFICATION HAPPENS.

[2018/01/22 17:01]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): That's not what Bioblaze told me last year.
[2018/01/22 17:02]  Pauleh Resident: I have a pretty simple yes or no question if a admin can answer it for me <3 - Can I still advertise if my supernatural sim that includes vampires, werewolves, witches etc but furies and children are not allowed?  Also the fact that my sim includes a lot of sex along with some bdsm elements, but as long as I don't put that in my notice I should be fine correct?
[2018/01/22 17:02]  SamanthaPrater Resident: how about some fun trivia, with possible prizes as my treat to you? (i've got some pets to give away and some outfits.)
[2018/01/22 17:02]  Aenelys (anneliese.wolfenhaut): Yes, Pauleh
[2018/01/22 17:02]  Pauleh Resident: Sweet, thank you
[2018/01/22 17:02]  Branwyn Emerald: Does sex without bdsm exsist in SL? :)
[2018/01/22 17:02]  SamanthaPrater Resident: Aen, trivia good to you?
[2018/01/22 17:03]  Shin (shinmakoto): I think right now disregard the last rule notice entirely and carry on is the verdict, Pauleh XD Just dont spam, beg for money, and keep your ads clean
[2018/01/22 17:03]  SamanthaPrater Resident: What shin said
[2018/01/22 17:03]  Branwyn Emerald: Yeah Paul, keep those adverts clean ...
[2018/01/22 17:03]  Shin (shinmakoto): Wash behind their ears
[2018/01/22 17:03]  SamanthaPrater Resident: apparently noone wants prizes.
[2018/01/22 17:03]  Missy (missaire.zimmermann): /me tosses out all of hers. They were filthy.

[2018/01/22 17:05]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): I don't know
[2018/01/22 17:05]  SamanthaPrater Resident: no-one should be losing notice rights..
[2018/01/22 17:05]  Yibo Chen (yibosoo): I was about to post an ad and now I can't click on the group notice button to make a group notice.
[2018/01/22 17:06]  Missy (missaire.zimmermann): Oooo.. I can :D WATCH OUT!!! (kidding)

[2018/01/24 16:37]  Haru Ducatillon: Date: October 15th, 562 AD. Location: Rural China.

[2018/01/29 16:05]  AstridNaess Resident: /me sighed as she took another box of cassette tapes that she didnt know who bought. "Seriously, guys, you need to be more aware of the market. Who the hell is buying cassette tapes anymore?" She shook the box and attempted to sort them. She organized them as best she could, checking out each tape before slipping it into a display slot. "Oooohhh." She says with a smile. "Well okay maybe not all of them are useless." She opens the boom box she had sitting there and popped the tape in. she hunts down a cord and plugs it into the wall. She hits the rewind button and looks to the two NPC staff of the lock and load pawn shop around her, "are you ready?" She asked with an excited grin. The rewind stops and she hits play. The intro starts and Sera bops her head "oh come on." She says hearing Tiny, the NPC biker security groan. "You know you love it!" And then the lyrics start and Sera jumps into the middle of the store to sing along!
