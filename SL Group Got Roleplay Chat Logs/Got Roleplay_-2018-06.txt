We have a number of smallfolk players, but no one with the drive to lead.  Is this you?

 Comraich is a medieval fantasy sim with an expansive custom lore.  We are an application sim, however we welcome visiting role-players in medieval clothing to not only come and observe, but come and role-play as well.  We have a “What is Known” page that gives an experienced role-player the information about Comraich that they need to get started.  Come explore, and explore again.  Three cities, two villages, and forests in between, every inch of the sim from top to bottom is packed with places to see.

[2018/06/07 19:01]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): Questions for your roleplayers... when exploring new sims where you dont know anyone... what do you notice first? what draws you? What brings you back?
[2018/06/07 19:03]  Amara (amara.parmelee): how willing people are to roleplay with me. How easy it is to join the roleplay sim as well
[2018/06/07 19:04]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): other than the obvious, rude people and clique's, people that dont leave their houses, what repels you from a sim
[2018/06/07 19:05]  ℳousie мoяbid ℛαveηcrόft (morbidmouse): lack of interaction i suppose
[2018/06/07 19:06]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): /me nods
[2018/06/07 19:06]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): makes sense
[2018/06/07 19:06]  Yasmin Hajii (lindsay.dover): unclear direction and lore
[2018/06/07 19:06]  ℳousie мoяbid ℛαveηcrόft (morbidmouse): if i manage to go im usual shy about new sims afraid i wont be dressed properly
[2018/06/07 19:06]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): what sort of direction do you like in the sim lore?
[2018/06/07 19:07]  Yasmin Hajii (lindsay.dover): definitive enough to establish the environment but logical enough that the lore can evolve with the player base
[2018/06/07 19:07]  Yasmin Hajii (lindsay.dover): not changing core values but allowing players stories to lend itself to further development
[2018/06/07 19:07]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): its a delicate balance to provide structure but not be too restrictive
[2018/06/07 19:08]  Yasmin Hajii (lindsay.dover): right
[2018/06/07 19:08]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): scripted rp is not an interest but some kind of guidelines set up to help people mesh in with the lore and create their own story and one to add to the sim in general would be ideal. just not constant scripted rp that you have to wiat for specific people to  be around
[2018/06/07 19:08]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): /me nods
[2018/06/07 19:08]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): do you like when there are pre-set factions
[2018/06/07 19:08]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): like say for urban there is an established police and crime family
[2018/06/07 19:09]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): yes thats fine but they have to be welcoming and not a pain to get into
[2018/06/07 19:09]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): /me nods
[2018/06/07 19:09]  Yasmin Hajii (lindsay.dover): no. preset factions can be annoying. let the rp drive their creation
[2018/06/07 19:09]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): or do you prefer no established factions and ahve players create their own
[2018/06/07 19:09]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): challenge is good but sometimes you just want to get started and i have found on most urban and modern sims theres not much to really go on
[2018/06/07 19:09]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): people tend to just stand around and have idle chit chat and not relaly anything else
[2018/06/07 19:09]  Yasmin Hajii (lindsay.dover): presets force players to conform their stories to fit what's there
[2018/06/07 19:09]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): not everywhere of course but enough places/
[2018/06/07 19:10]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): If players want to be in a sim their story should be able to meld in with the sim plot.
[2018/06/07 19:10]  Alice Fairchild (alicefairchild): Also, sims should have a plot.
[2018/06/07 19:10]  Alice Fairchild (alicefairchild): That evolves over time.
[2018/06/07 19:10]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): a plot?
[2018/06/07 19:10]  Alice Fairchild (alicefairchild): Things that change for characters to react to.
[2018/06/07 19:11]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): as opposed to merely being an open ended stage for players to cultivate their own plot
[2018/06/07 19:11]  Alice Fairchild (alicefairchild): Yeah, you need both.
[2018/06/07 19:11]  Kali (kaliope.karas): i agree that you need a backdrop, a setting
[2018/06/07 19:11]  Yasmin Hajii (lindsay.dover): yes, the backdrop (lore) is important but should allowe for player evolution
[2018/06/07 19:11]  Kali (kaliope.karas): but everything else is open ended, as long as you keep to lore
[2018/06/07 19:11]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): a foundation
[2018/06/07 19:12]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): i imagine most urban sims have the standard medical, legal, and fire set up but beyond that... im sort of confused about the plot
[2018/06/07 19:12]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): but still plenty of space for people to add
[2018/06/07 19:12]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): and grow themselves with the sim
[2018/06/07 19:12]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): ive seen very few modern with a plot. but im also someone whose spent a lot more time in medi fantasy and things just seem to move more fluidly in those. i think because its just easier maybe. im not sure. i guess it depends on the players
[2018/06/07 19:13]  Yasmin Hajii (lindsay.dover): Urban is so close to RL usually that it's just as boring as our RLs lol
[2018/06/07 19:13]  Kali (kaliope.karas): I agree Seraphine, many ubran are very open ended, just allowing the players to create their own plots.  There's nothing "special" to learn about the place or the "world" the characters live in
[2018/06/07 19:13]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): can you give an example of a good "plot" from a medieval sim... im sure i can adapt it to modern
[2018/06/07 19:14]  Alice Fairchild (alicefairchild): Regicide! The king has died, and all the various nobles must vie for favor in order to become the next monarch. Or, you're at war with a neighboring country! How does that change daily life for everyone as there are now stricter requirements on how to buy food and weapons, and now that people are being drafted for the army?
[2018/06/07 19:14]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): lol if there was an ubran sim id want urban fantasy so its not rl. and i dont mind seeing different races walking around
[2018/06/07 19:14]  Kali (kaliope.karas): i played in Svera Beach a while.  They had a "lore".  it was the not so distant future, california,
[2018/06/07 19:15]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): as for a medi fantasy on thats tricky
[2018/06/07 19:15]  Alice Fairchild (alicefairchild): I'm working on a 1920s Urban Fantasy sim, because I wanted to be able to drive the plot with magic and scifi.
[2018/06/07 19:15]  Kali (kaliope.karas): magic is hard to write for
[2018/06/07 19:15]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): ive seen things with magic be big parts of medi fantasy sims. but sometimes they do get repetitive so you got to be able to adapt and modify and all that
[2018/06/07 19:15]  Kali (kaliope.karas): at least for rp
[2018/06/07 19:15]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): and that sounds interesting Alice
[2018/06/07 19:15]  Yasmin Hajii (lindsay.dover): magic always seems to get out of hand
[2018/06/07 19:16]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): ahhh so in Alice's example... the admin team would provide scenerios for the players to include in their roleplay such as tax hikes, or famine
[2018/06/07 19:16]  Alice Fairchild (alicefairchild): Yeah, things for the characters to react to.
[2018/06/07 19:16]  Kali (kaliope.karas): when you write a book you have full control of the magic and what the characters can/can't do.  you can't always easily limit that in rp
[2018/06/07 19:16]  Alice Fairchild (alicefairchild): You give them an evolving setting, so that they can react to it - because a ton of RP comes out of that.
[2018/06/07 19:16]  Kali (kaliope.karas): and yes, those happen in urban environments too
[2018/06/07 19:16]  Kali (kaliope.karas): mini plots
[2018/06/07 19:16]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): yes yes they can
[2018/06/07 19:17]  Alice Fairchild (alicefairchild): So sorry, that was what I meant by 'plot'. Evolution of the setting over time.
[2018/06/07 19:17]  Kali (kaliope.karas): floods, ntural disasters, epidemics
[2018/06/07 19:17]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): have to keep things interesting which is difficult in points because roleplayers as a whole can be pretty fickle
[2018/06/07 19:17]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): so maybe a sim wide plot every month or one that extends and isnt an easy end
[2018/06/07 19:17]  Kali (kaliope.karas): and not all may want to participate in a sim wide
[2018/06/07 19:17]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): and events that are not boring happening
[2018/06/07 19:17]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): you need bad guys and conflict but you dont want to overdo it either
[2018/06/07 19:18]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): ive definitely been on sims where they tried a sim-wide plot thing... and it flopped
[2018/06/07 19:18]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): because people felt it infringed on their curent story
[2018/06/07 19:18]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): Events are super key
[2018/06/07 19:18]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): but im not a big fan of OOC events
[2018/06/07 19:18]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): like dances
[2018/06/07 19:18]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): with DJs and just basic chater
[2018/06/07 19:18]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): chatter*
[2018/06/07 19:19]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): yeh you want things that people can take part in if they choose but at same time arent forced. but sims are not just about single players' stories, they tend to involve multiple stories and people all there and if the rp is good things can be connected
[2018/06/07 19:19]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): ideally yes
[2018/06/07 19:19]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): personal stories can still be connected to many people or in response to something that went on while they were rping with others or just the sim story in general
[2018/06/07 19:20]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): the idea is to bring the rp's togehter and not just cliques doing their own thing
[2018/06/07 19:20]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): yes
[2018/06/07 19:21]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): this feedback is invaluable
[2018/06/07 19:21]  Malvakai Paine: I'd like to be an NPC, my character could help advance plot without worrying about my personal story arc
[2018/06/07 19:21]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): thank you for being so open to discuss stuff
[2018/06/07 19:22]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): On the case of NPCs they are good to have to move plots along but actual player involvement is most certainly better in the long run. But I too might have an NPC to help push things along or cause a bit of havoc but overall the main would be involved in sim wide things as much as possible
[2018/06/07 19:22]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): stories that rely heavily on npcs are not nearly as interesting
[2018/06/07 19:22]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): just makes it easier so players dont necessarily have to kill themselves off
[2018/06/07 19:22]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): an NPC or two to start a scene makes sense but they shouldnt be major plot figures
[2018/06/07 19:22]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): IMO
[2018/06/07 19:23]  Malvakai Paine: i agree
[2018/06/07 19:24]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): I also like to see Leads of sims being a strong part of the sim rp but not as the main heroin or villain. but those who are present but spending more time pushing rp along and creating the foundation for their faction and understanding the rp isnt about them its about the players within their factions because as a lead you are the back scenes. you can be bigger as well but the prime focus should be helping to supply rp for the many players in your faction or on the sim
[2018/06/07 19:25]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): /menods
[2018/06/07 19:25]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): admins as support players rather than just catalysts?
[2018/06/07 19:25]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): yes
[2018/06/07 19:25]  Malvakai Paine: i like that
[2018/06/07 19:26]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): and admins that are not  biased and can be an admin without being biased and actually being a bit open minded and willing to listen to people and help them out
[2018/06/07 19:26]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): ideally admins are chosen for their ability to compartmentalize rather than be emotional
[2018/06/07 19:26]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): ie not every friend is a good admin
[2018/06/07 19:26]  Vex Tsar Zarkov (vexthewarwolf): ^-
[2018/06/07 19:27]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): nod
[2018/06/07 19:27]  Vex Tsar Zarkov (vexthewarwolf): or who ever your married to or date
[2018/06/07 19:27]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): flavor of the month admins
[2018/06/07 19:27]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): a harem of admins
[2018/06/07 19:27]  Vex Tsar Zarkov (vexthewarwolf): xD SIETTT
[2018/06/07 19:27]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): you dont want too many captains of the ship
[2018/06/07 19:28]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): of course
[2018/06/07 19:29]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): have to be very careful with admins
[2018/06/07 19:29]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): some get power hungry unfortunatly.
[2018/06/07 19:29]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): /me nods
[2018/06/07 19:29]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): but there should be a clear chain of command also
[2018/06/07 19:29]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): in any sim
[2018/06/07 19:29]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): Owner Admins Faction Leads Mentors, ect
[2018/06/07 19:29]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): /me nods
[2018/06/07 19:30]  JaSuri Baize (airuhlagertha): with clearly known responsbilities for smoothest running, kind of like a business
[2018/06/07 19:30]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): yes clear communication is good for any relationship including roleplay ones

[2018/06/08 18:34]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): well thats cause the goal isnt rp
[2018/06/08 18:34]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): the goal is L
[2018/06/08 18:34]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): at least that is how i read it
[2018/06/08 18:38]  Niccia Straaf: dunno, must be
[2018/06/08 18:39]  Niccia Straaf: sucks, that
[2018/06/08 18:39]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): i thin i went there
[2018/06/08 18:39]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): its very flat
[2018/06/08 18:39]  Seraphine Morello (astridnaess): such is life
[2018/06/09 16:34]  Starry Questi: The Wild Card
 
 She wakes up on the sidewalk, the concrete cool against her bare skin, standing, she still has a firm grip on her pistol.  Cheating the Russian mafia on that last deal was probably not a good idea.  But that really doesn't really explain what happened to her clothes or how she got here.  In a nearby abandoned building she finds something to wear, &  box of ammo.  As she begins to explore the city she discovers she is not in Kansas anymore.

 Thank you very much for treating him that way.   Whether it was your pedantic grammar and punctuation enforcement, or your cold fish emotes. Possibly your idea of a hot time is slow dancing to jazz and coco by the fire.  I don't know and I don't need to know.  All the women say a hard man is good to find, and yours plays here now.
