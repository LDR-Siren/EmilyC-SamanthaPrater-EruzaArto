[2018/02/02 18:12]  AstridNaess Resident: Realistic 1% Outlaw Motorcycle Club out of Santa Romona Valley, CA is looking for prospects. Able bodied men, with a sense of loyalty and brotherhood would be excellent additions. We are looking for para/semi para role players who are interested in engaging in some criminal roleplay. (Think Sons of Anarchy) Let me know if you are interested.

[2018/02/03 17:58]  AstridNaess Resident: /me having recovered from her hang over, well rested, well hydrated, Sera made her way down to the Watering Hole. She had a new man starting, a bouncer, Cecil. A big fat bald guy (NPC). He was in charge of checking IDs and keeping things in order outside the door. Maybe even to give a heads up if some disorder happens outside. As Sera made her way behind the bar she looked around and smiled. The place was just perfect for her. She sorted through some glasses, reconfiguring them and restocking some bottles from shipments. She wanted a well stocked bar. She kept the craft beers in one cooler and the generic domestics in another. She was all set for a Saturday at Santa Romona Valley.

[2018/02/15 16:12]  Sarah Brooke (sarahjbrooke): Well honestly I find the partner is more important than the character of the roleplay really, but the thing on my mind was something really simple... simpler than I've ever done before... just a wedding night, between a couple who are deeply in love.
[2018/02/15 16:13]  Anthony Antonelli (bqfromny): LOl Sarah is trouble ;)
