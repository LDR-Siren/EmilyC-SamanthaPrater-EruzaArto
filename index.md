*Foot note* Some of the information in here is not for the light of heart or for those that have never dealt with a [Trollorist](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=trollorist). IF you have never dealt with this form of individual that we have come to know as someone worse than a typical internet troll, please turn back now. In all seriousness, this person is dangerous and has mentally damaged several individuals, some even to harm themselves thanks to her bullying, gaslight, and narcassistic behavior towards them. This is not a joke, or a game. Some of us are still going through therapy thanks to her. And the Discord group The Dibney Cru has been the biggest support to many of us and have got us through the hardest times, and likely more, with this individual.

If you are in need of help or support thanks to this individual, please contact an Admin on the [Trollorist Forum](https://trollorist.forumotion.com), we are here to help and hear your story.
